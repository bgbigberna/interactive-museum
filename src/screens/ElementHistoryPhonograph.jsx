            The phonograph, invented by Thomas Edison in 1877, was the first device capable of recording and reproducing sound. 
            It used a cylinder covered in tinfoil to capture sound waves, which were then played back by a needle tracing the grooves on the cylinder. 
            The phonograph revolutionized the music industry and paved the way for modern audio recording and playback technologies.
