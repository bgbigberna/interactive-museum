            The Electric Pen, invented by Thomas Edison in 1876, 
            was a revolutionary device designed primarily for duplicating
            documents. The pen operated using a small electric motor that 
            powered a needle, which rapidly punctured paper to create a 
            stencil. This stencil could then be used with an ink roller to 
            produce multiple copies of the original document. Although the 
            device itself was bulky and noisy, it represented a significant 
            step toward modern electric appliances and office automation. 
            The Electric Pen is considered one of the earliest examples of 
            electric writing instruments and served as a precursor to tattoo 
            machines and duplicating technologies. Its design demonstrated Edisonâ€™s 
            talent for combining electrical innovation with practical applications in everyday life.
